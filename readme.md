# Orange Rabbit Code Challenge

<h3>The assignment</h3>
Create an event sign up form

The assignment will test your ability to:
* Implement a simple design (from Figma) using HTML & CSS. (login with a free Figma account to be able to inspect the design)
* Do simple DOM manipulation with Javascript (creating, inserting, deleting elements, event listeners, etc.).
* Manipulate data structures with JavaScript.
* Write asynchronous JavaScript.
* Make requests to an API.
<strong>The form will be used by users who want to sign up themselves and optional additional participants for an event.</strong>

<strong>The form starts with the following fields:<strong>
* Name
* Email address
* Phone number
* Birthdate

Use the correct input types for the fields above.

Then, the user should have the option to add the same fields to add more participants. 
<br>It should also be possible to remove the additional participants but not the main participant.

The form data should be submitted (async) to an API endpoint (just use a fake URL). Suppose that the endpoint accepts a JSON body with the structure defined further down. Note that thereâ€™s an additional ID field for each participant which is not part of the form.
